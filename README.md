# EveryplayANE
Adobe AIR SDK - **Android**

# Information
Welcome to Everyplay.  
Everyplay uses Android SDKs as well as built-in device functionality to **capture your game's video and audio as it's played**.  

From the [FAQ](https://developers.everyplay.com/documentation/Frequently-asked-questions.md "Everyplay's FAQ")  
It helps your game succeed through:  
**Game Discovery**  
The most powerful way for players to discover new games is when friends show off the games they love - acquire new players through mobile replay sharing.  
**Engagement**  
Create fans, enable players to bring in friends, and build a connected community directly within your mobile game.  
**Personal Experiences**  
Everyplay lets players capture those spontaneous magical moments they experience when playing your game.  
**User Generated Content**  
Everyplay allows your game to become a way for players to create their own stories within your game - stories they can then share. This can range from player-led tutorials and walkthroughs to personal jokes with friends.  
**Seamless Integration**  
Great for your users and even better for you - all the video game discovery, social sharing, personal expression, and more happens automatically within your game.
